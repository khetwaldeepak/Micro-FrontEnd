# Micro Apps with Web Components and Angular Elements

This example consists of three Angular projects that demonstrate how to use Web Components/ Angular Elements to implement a shell that loads micro apps:

- **shell (/src):** Shell loading micro apps
- **case-notes (/projects/case-notes)**: Demo micro app
- **office-s (/projects/office-s)**: Another demo micro app

## Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run specific micro app


Use one of the following commands for this:

```
npm run build:office-s  - to just build office-s micro app/Front End
npm run build:case-notes - to just build case-notes micro app/Front End
```

## Everything together

For using everything together, you have to build the example and run it:

```
npm run build
npm start
```
